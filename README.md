**Backend**
- Python
- Pycaret: An automated machine learning library used to streamline the model development process for all three machine learning tasks.
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- Pydantic: A data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations, facilitating data parsing and validation for easier error handling and enforcement of type constraints.
- MLflow: Utilized for tracking experiments, including parameter logging, metrics, and model versioning, to enhance model management and reproducibility.
- DVC: Data Version Control was used to track and manage datasets and their versions, ensuring consistency across all stages of the project.
- HYDRA: Employed for managing and configuring the application's environment, making it easier to switch between different setups without changing the codebase.
- POETRY: Used for dependency management and packaging of project, ensuring that all necessary libraries are installed and maintained correctly.

**Frontend**
- Next.js: A React framework for building user interfaces, optimized for a smoother developer experience and high-performance applications.
- HeroUI, ShadCN, and tailwindcss
